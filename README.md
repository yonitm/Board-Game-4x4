This project contains an implementation via Logisim and its conversion to Verilog HDL. Note that in the Verilog HDL implementation, the game can be reset by using the "reset" signal. This is a board game: the player collects prizes over a board in size 4x4.
Each cell on the board represented by an ordered pair (y,x), 0\ley,x\le3. In the beginning of the game, each cell contains a prize defined by prize(y,x)=y+x. The starting point of the player is (0,0). At  every clock cycle, the player moves in one of 4 directions: north (00), south (01), west (10) or east (11). Note that the player earns the prize in the cell only when visiting it for the first time.
At each clock cycle, the player (via testbench) gives an input (00, 01, 10 or 11) that determines the direction of the progress. The cells represented by 4 bits each  that are a concatenation of {y,x}. That means that if the direction to the next cell is vertical (00 or 01), that affects only  the value of y: adding 1 for south or subtracting 1 for north. When the direction is horizontal (10 or 11), its affects only the value of x,  by adding 1 for east or subtracting 1 for west. 
When finding which is the next cell to visit, the prize being calculated as described above: x+y for first visit, 0 else.
